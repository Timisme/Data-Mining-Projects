## Using Bi-LSTMs, Conditional Random Fields and the Viterbi Algorithm__


Bi-LSTM Diagram
---

Looks complicated, but really just a lot of vector concatenations and a couple LSTMs (one running in reverse).  Hope this is clear, but see references in tutorial for more context (lol, get it?  context?).
